Hi, Iâ€™m Ada Keita :wave:


I am a <developer> living in Oslo, Norway. My interest in development got sparked in the fall of 2021, and I spent the next year learning everything I could on a laptop in my apartment. 
I started school to learn even more about front-end development in the fall of 2022, and have spent my free time  learning the basics of back-end and cyber security. 

Currently working with

-css3
-html5
-vanilla js
-React
-pyhton(still fresh)
-sql


I would love to connect with more developers, feel free to contact me on hello@adakeita.dev!
